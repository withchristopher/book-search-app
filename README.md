## Book Search App 
This application allows you to search for books by typing a topic into a search bar. The application was built using the MERN stack and is deployed on Heroku.


### Description
Combined the four technologies of the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js).

### How it works
Users will be able to sign up and create an account. Once signed in, click the search bar and search for a book of your choice. The Google Books API will return a list of books related to your search term. You can then save a book to your list.

### Technologies uses in this project:

* GraphQL : query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling queries
* Apollo Server : open-source, spec-compliant GraphQL server
* React Router
* if-env : npm package
* concurrently : npm package
* JWT-decode : JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are an alternative to using session cookies for authentication.
